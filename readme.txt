VOICE ENGINE NOTE:

The standard voice engine used within Jarvis will be the one that is set as default on the users system.
If you type the command 'voice', you can change to Jarvis' voice that we use. This voice is 'Lawrence' by Cepstral, with an effect, and is far superior to Window's offering. The only issue is that of a legal one.
You will need to buy a license from Cepstral to stop the constant nagging, this we apologise for.
Thank you.
